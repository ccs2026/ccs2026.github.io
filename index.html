  The 2026 Conference on Complex Systems will be held in Binghamton, New York, USA. The Binghamton Center of Complex Systems (CoCo) at Binghamton University will act as the hosting organization. Binghamton, New York, has a long history of creativity and innovation. The Greater Binghamton area has historically been called Ågthe Valley of OpportunityÅh and attracted many immigrants (especially from Europe) since the mid-1800s, which has made the regionÅfs rich and diverse culture and demographics. It is the birthplace of IBM (International Business Machines), Link Flight Simulator, McIntosh Laboratory, and a number of other pioneering ventures, fostering a spirit of ingenuity that continues to thrive. Located at the confluence of the Susquehanna river (one of the oldest rivers in the world) and the Chenango river, the region boasts stunning natural beauty and offers ample opportunities for outdoor recreation, from hiking and biking to fishing and kayaking. In particular, in mid-October when CCS 2026 is held, the Binghamton area will showcase its renowned and breathtaking fall foliage. Furthermore, a vibrant arts and culture scene flourishes here, with numerous galleries, theaters, and music venues providing enriching experiences.

Binghamton is accessible directly from New York City by frequent three-hour highway bus connections (by Greyhound, FlixBus, OurBus, etc.). It is also served by the Binghamton Regional Airport that offers direct flights to Detroit and by several other airports nearby (Syracuse, Scranton, Ithaca, and Elmira airports, each of which is about an hour ride to Binghamton). For international participants, it is most convenient to come to New York City and take a highway bus from there. See below for more information about transportation to Binghamton University:
